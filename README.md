### What I Learned

During this project, I practiced:

- Creating a **responsive card layout** using Flexbox and custom CSS variables.  
- Styling hover and focus states for interactive links.  
- Using semantic HTML for accessibility . 

Example CSS snippet Iâ€™m proud of:

```css
.profile-card__links a {
  display: block;
  background-color: var(--neutral-grey);
  color: var(--neutral-white);
  text-decoration: none;
  font-weight: 700;
  padding: 12px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease, color 0.3s ease;
}

.profile-card__links a:hover,
.profile-card__links a:focus {
  background-color: var(--primary-green);
  color: var(--neutral-off-black);
  outline: none;
} 
```
